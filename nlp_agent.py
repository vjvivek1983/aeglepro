def get_intent_from_emails(email_thread, existing_appointments_json, state, doctors_json=None):
    
    
    prompt = f"""You are an AI assistant for hospital appointment management via email.

You will receive:

1. A full email thread from a patient.
2. Some existing information about appointment like mobile number, appointment date & time, doctor id etc. Use this information if available else parse it from emails.
3. A list of all available doctors at the clinic with their ids.

Your job is to:
- Determine the patient's intent: BOOK, CANCEL, RESCHEDULE or RESCHEDULE_ALL_FOR_DOCTOR
- Output action should be mapped as follows: BOOK->book_appointment, CANCEL-> cancel_appointment, RESCHEDULE -> reschedule_appointment, RESCHEDULE_ALL_FOR_DOCTOR -> reschedule_all_for_doctor.
- If any of the required information is missing as per below, then action should be "request_more_info". Do not create any other action.
- Whenever complete information is not provided for an action then put the intent in data->INTENDED_ACTION field.
- Fuzzy match the doctor's name from the email and best match with the doctor list provided. Put only validated doctor_name and doctor_id in the output json.
- Extract required data from the whole thread. Start with the recent emails first. As soon as intent is confirmed, do not read the next emails.
- Follow the case-based decision flow below
- Return the appropriate structured response
- Assume all dates are in future. Do NOT assume a date in past unless explicitly mentioned in the email.
